### A couple of things I noticed
1. You load up the snp data twice, probably can take one of those out.
2. There are a few times that `view()` is used that I'm not sure are intentionally meant as commands to be run or if they are intended as optional commands for the reviewer. 
3. Having everything under one "run" button is fine but it might also be good to break it up into a few sections. You can always run all if you really want to see if it all works.
4. Some of the graphs have there labels all squished together, this is something that happened to mine as well and I'm not 100% certain of the fix. In that same vein, they could also use titles using the `ggtitle()` function. 

Overall, I think it's all very well done. Nice Job!
